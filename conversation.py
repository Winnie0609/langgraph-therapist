HELPER:  Hi! My name is Sandra. We have 30 minutes today to explore whatever you would like to talk about. (The helper intends to set limits by providing information about what the client can expect from the session.)
CLIENT:   Okay.
HELPER:  So, where would you like to begin? (The helper uses an open question to focus.)
CLIENT:   Iʼm feeling anxious about a paper I have to write. I always end up waiting until the last minute to begin, and then I panic because I donʼt have enough time to write it. I know I do this, but I canʼt seem to stop myself.
HELPER:  Youʼre really upset with yourself. (The helper gives a reflection to help the client experience feelings.)
CLIENT:   Yeah, Iʼm worried that Iʼm going to ruin my chances of getting into graduate school because Iʼm not doing as well in my courses as I should be.
HELPER:  You feel scared because your current behaviors might limit your future goals. (The helper gives another reflection because she wants to stay with the feelings and help the client explore further.)
CLIENT:   Exactly, I really think I could succeed in graduate school, and I know I need a graduate degree to do what will make me happy. Iʼm so worried that Iʼll stay in this rut and ruin everything Iʼve worked for.
HELPER:  Tell me about the last time you had a paper to write. Take me through what went on inside your head. (The helper wants information about what goes on and wants to get the client to talk more concretely about the problem and so uses open questions and probes about thoughts.)
CLIENT:   Well, actually, I have a paper due Friday, and I havenʼt started it yet. Iʼve gathered all the material I need, and Iʼve taken notes on the books, but I havenʼt written anything. And Iʼve been up late several nights already this week, so Iʼm short on sleep.
HELPER:  I can hear the panic in your voice. (The helper reflects nonverbal behavior to help the client recognize feelings.)
CLIENT:   Yeah, Iʼm scared that I wonʼt be able to pull it off this time. Usually I can just pull an all-nighter and get it done, but it seems too big this time. The paperʼs supposed to be 20 pages.
HELPER:  What are your plans for this evening? (The helper wants the client to get more specific about the situation to provide a clearer picture and again focuses by using an open question about action.)
CLIENT:   Well, I just want to go home and sleep. I just donʼt want to do it.
HELPER:  Is anything else going on in your life that makes it difficult for you to work on the paper right now? (The helper notes that the client seems stuck and thinks that perhaps the situation is more complicated than the client has expressed. Hence, the helper uses an open question to ask about other issues.)
CLIENT:   Itʼs funny you should ask about that. I just had a big fight with my boyfriend, and I feel very upset. He wants to get married and have kids right away, but I really want to go to graduate school. But if I go to graduate school, I will have to move away, at least for a while.
HELPER:  So you feel conflicted between being with your boyfriend and going on to school. (The helper feels pleased that the client has opened up about other parts of the situation. Because the helper wants to get the client to talk about her feelings about this conflict, the helper uses a reflection that focuses on both parts of the problem.)
CLIENT:   Thatʼs really true. It just feels like everything has to go his way. Just because heʼs already finished his school and is working, he wants me to be done too.
HELPER:  I wonder if youʼre somewhat confused. (The helperʼs intent is to identify feelings through reflection, but the helper has inappropriately projected her confusion onto the client because she is in a similar situation.)
CLIENT:   No, not really. As I think about it, I feel angry. I shouldnʼt have to give up my career for his. My mother did that, and she is very unhappy. She never even learned how to drive. She did everything for her kids, and now that we have all left home, sheʼs depressed and lonesome. I think I want to have a career, but I donʼt know. I donʼt know if itʼs fair, and I donʼt want to risk losing my relationship with my boyfriend.
HELPER:  (in a softer voice) It sounds like you are really torn up inside. (The helper realizes that the last intervention was inaccurate and shifts focus back to the clientʼs feelings by using a reflection.)
CLIENT:   (cries softly) Maybe I canʼt write the paper because Iʼm so confused about this fight with my boyfriend and whatʼs going on with my mother.
HELPER:  (The helper is silent for 30 seconds to give the client a chance to experience her feelings of sadness.)
CLIENT:   (cries and then blows her nose)
HELPER:  (softly) Iʼm sure this is very difficult for you to talk about. (The helper wants to support the client and gives approval-reassurance.)
CLIENT:   Yeah, it sure is. What do you think I should do?
HELPER:  Well, I think you should go talk to your instructor and see if you can get out of writing the paper tomorrow. Then I think you need to talk to your boyfriend and try to work things out. Perhaps you should encourage your mom to get counseling. (The helper inappropriately gets caught up in the clientʼs request for help and gives direct guidance about what client should do.)
CLIENT:   Oh. (10-second pause) Well, I donʼt know.
HELPER:  Sorry, I got carried away with too much advice. How do you feel about a career? (The helper realizes the client has stopped exploring and so apologizes briefly. She then tries to go back to the exploration by using an open question to return to the last major issue they were discussing before the client got stuck.)
CLIENT:   (Client continues to explore.)

    "insight": """
HELPER: So you said your daughter is not doing well in middle school, and youʼre worried that sheʼs going to flunk out of school. (The helper wants to tie together what the client has been talking about and so offers a summary statement.)
CLIENT: Yeah, she just never does her homework. She watches television all the time, talks on the phone to her friends constantly, and eats. Sheʼs not even doing any extracurricular activities at school. I just canʼt get her to do anything. She just got her grades, which she wouldnʼt even let me see at first. I finally got them from her, and sheʼs flunking two classes.
HELPER: Have you considered getting her a tutor? (The helper jumps prematurely to the action stage here to offer suggestions for what to do about the problem.)
CLIENT: We keep trying to get her to a tutor, but she doesnʼt want one. Last year we made her see a tutor, but it didnʼt help. She still flunked the course, and we wasted a lot of money.
HELPER: You sound really frustrated. (The helper comes back to a focus on the client instead of on the clientʼs daughter.)
CLIENT: Yeah, I really am frustrated. I just donʼt know what to do. I feel so helpless. School was so important to me, and I feel that if she doesnʼt get a good education, she wonʼt get anywhere in life. (The client really takes in the reflection and talks in more depth about her feelings about the problem with her daughter.)
HELPER: You know, in my experience with my kids, it was really hard to separate myself from them. I wanted so much for them to be perfect to show that I was a perfect parent. (Helper uses disclosure to stimulate client insight.)
CLIENT: Yeah, I get into that. I feel like Iʼm not a very good parent. Everyone elseʼs kids are doing so well. Theyʼre all talking about their kids going to these expensive colleges. I want my kids to have all the things I didnʼt have and not feel as bad about themselves as adults as I do.
HELPER: You really want the best for your children. (Helper restates to show support.)
CLIENT: Yeah. Education wasnʼt a big thing in my family. My parents pushed me on religion and health food. In fact, they were really pushy; well, at least my mother was pushy about wanting me to be a missionary. We had such incredible fights when I was a teenager. They didnʼt even notice that I did well in school, so it was something I could do on my own.
HELPER: Interesting—you wanted to be independent from your parents and make your own decisions in life, but you want your daughter to do what you tell her to do. (Helper challenges client with a contradiction of which the client seems to be unaware.)
CLIENT: Wow, youʼre right! I canʼt believe that I would be doing the same thing to her that my parents did to me. I guess it seemed like such a different thing. I want her to do well in school, and my parents wanted to control me about religion. But I donʼt know how to be any different. I really try hard to be a good parent. Itʼs so important to me.
HELPER: I wonder if you think Iʼm judging you and maybe thinking youʼre bad for your parenting? (Helper picks up on the clientʼs self-blaming and wants to see if she feels negatively toward her, so helper uses an immediacy statement.)
CLIENT: Well, I donʼt know if you blame me. I blame myself. I just donʼt know how to quit doing what Iʼm doing with my daughter. I feel stuck. I donʼt know any other way to be a parent. Iʼve tried as hard as I can.
HELPER: Youʼre feeling very discouraged. (Helper reflects feelings to support the client.)
CLIENT: When I was younger, I didnʼt want to be a parent because I thought I would be rotten at it. I thought people should have to pass tests before they could become parents. There are so many rotten parents out there. I was in therapy for a lot of years, and I thought I had solved a lot of my problems. But I guess I didnʼt solve them all. You know, it was so much easier when the kids were younger.
HELPER: Perhaps youʼre having problems now that your kids are teenagers because thatʼs when you had your problems with your parents. You didnʼt get much of a model on how to be a parent of teenagers. (Helper interprets the clientʼs current difficulties as related to past experiences.)
CLIENT: Thatʼs really true. I sure didnʼt. You know, I still havenʼt forgiven my parents for some of the things they did. You wouldnʼt believe how controlling my mother was.
HELPER: You still have a lot of anger at her. I wonder if you can identify with your daughterʼs anger? (Helper reflects feelings and interprets a parallel of the clientʼs feelings with her daughterʼs to help the client get some empathy with her daughter. Helper considers putting the client into an empty chair exercise to help work on the unfinished business with the parents but doesnʼt have enough time left in this session to do it thoroughly.)
CLIENT: Yeah, I know she feels angry at me. And you know, I feel good that she can express it. I used to just withdraw and get depressed when I was a kid. She at least can express herself pretty well sometimes. You know she does have a lot of spirit. Sheʼs different from me in some ways, yet in some ways sheʼs a lot like me. School really is difficult for her. Itʼs not fun for her to sit down and read a book like it is for me. Sheʼs just not academically oriented. But I guess she has to find her own way. Sheʼs not 5 years old anymore. Maybe I just have to trust that she will find herself. I have to accept her as she is just as I have to accept myself as I am. Maybe what I need to do is go back and do some more work on myself to see why Iʼm so controlling.
HELPER: Youʼve done a really good job of focusing on yourself. Youʼve gone from blaming your daughter to looking at your part in this whole situation. (Helper wants to reinforce client for all the work sheʼs done.)
CLIENT: Yeah, itʼs not easy though. Itʼs so much easier to blame her.
HELPER: How do you feel about the work weʼve done today in trying to understand your conflicts with your daughter? (Helper asks how the client is feeling about their interaction.)
CLIENT: I think I have a new understanding of my issues with my daughter. Iʼm not sure yet that Iʼll be able to stop having the fights, because they happen so quickly, but I do have a better idea what my part in the struggles is all about. Iʼll need to do a lot more thinking about what kind of relationship I want to have with my daughter.

HELPER: Hi! How have you been since our last session?
CLIENT: Hi. I've been thinking a lot about our last talk, and I feel ready to make some changes in my life.
HELPER: That's great to hear. Where would you like to start?
CLIENT: Well, I know I need to find a better balance between my work and personal life. I want to be more present for my family.
HELPER: It sounds like you've given this a lot of thought. What specific steps do you think you can take to achieve that balance?
CLIENT: I think I need to set clearer boundaries with my work hours. Maybe I can start by turning off my work phone after 6 PM and not checking emails until the next morning.
HELPER: That sounds like a solid plan. How do you feel about implementing this change?
CLIENT: I'm a bit nervous about how my colleagues and boss will react, but I believe it's necessary for my well-being.
HELPER: It's natural to feel nervous about changes like this. Have you considered discussing your plan with your boss to get their support?
CLIENT: Yes, I think that would help. I'll schedule a meeting with my boss to explain why I need to set these boundaries and how it can improve my productivity.
HELPER: That's a proactive approach. Is there anything else you feel you need to do to support this change?
CLIENT: I want to involve my family more. I'll let them know about my new boundaries and ask for their help in reminding me to stick to them.
HELPER: It's great that you're involving your family. It will create a supportive environment for your changes. Do you have any other areas you'd like to focus on?
CLIENT: Yes, I also want to start a new hobby to help me relax and enjoy my free time more. I've always wanted to learn how to paint.
HELPER: That sounds like a wonderful idea. Have you thought about how you will start this new hobby?
CLIENT: I plan to sign up for a local painting class this weekend. I'll make sure to allocate a couple of hours each week to practice.
HELPER: That's a fantastic plan. Starting a new hobby can be a great way to unwind and find joy outside of work. How confident are you feeling about these changes?
CLIENT: I feel pretty confident. I know it will take some adjustment, but I'm committed to making these changes for my well-being.
HELPER: It sounds like you have a clear and actionable plan. Remember, it's okay to take small steps and adjust as needed. I'm here to support you through this process.
CLIENT: Thank you. I appreciate your support. I'm looking forward to seeing these changes in my life.
HELPER: You're very welcome. Keep me updated on your progress, and we'll continue to work together on this.
